<h3> more about me </h3>

<p>
        I'm a high school student from the state of Minnesota, with a passion for learning and a love for both academic pursuits and leisure activities.
    My academic interests are diverse, but I particularly excel in reading and mathematics. I enjoy getting lost in a good book or solving a challenging math problem. These subjects not only fuel my curiosity but also help me develop critical thinking skills that I apply to various aspects of my life.
    When I'm not hitting the books, you'll often find me immersed in the world of video games. I love the strategic thinking, problem-solving, and creativity that many games require.
    During the summer months, I dedicate my time to volunteering at a local camp. This experience has been incredibly rewarding, allowing me to give back to my community while developing leadership skills and making lasting memories.
    Family is a central part of my life, and I cherish the moments we spend together. Our household is lively and full of love, thanks in part to our four-legged (and spiky!) family members - two playful dogs and two adorable hedgehogs. They bring joy and laughter to our daily lives and have taught me valuable lessons about responsibility and care.
    Through this website, I hope to share more about my interests, experiences, and thoughts. Feel free to explore and get to know me better!
